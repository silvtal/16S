### Description
The `abundance_tables_goldford` folder contains all the output tables generated with this pipeline for the aforementioned paper.
- `original_table.from_biom_0.99.txt` includes samples at "transfer 0", before culturing in different minimal media. This table was used for the simulations and is also included in the corresponding [repository](https://github.com/silvtal/phyloassembly/tree/main/simulations).
- `glucose_tr12.txt`, `citrate_tr12.txt` and `leucine_tr12.txt` include the endpoint communities for each minimal medium.
- `tr1_X2_X6_table.from_biom_0.99.txt` includes reads from transfer 1 of samples 2 and 6 growing in glucose. Also used for simulations.
- `tr2_X2_X6_table.from_biom_0.99.txt` includes reads from transfer 1 of samples 2 and 6 growing in glucose. Also used for simulations.
- `tr7_X2_X6_table.from_biom_0.99.txt` includes reads from transfer 1 of samples 2 and 6 growing in glucose. Also used for simulations.
